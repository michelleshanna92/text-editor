##Description
I developed a versatile text editor application that functions seamlessly both online and offline. The primary focus was on implementing various data persistence options to ensure data integrity under any circumstances. The application utilizes indexedDB as the first choice for data retrieval, falling back to local storage if indexedDB is inaccessible. Additionally, the application can be downloaded as a desktop application for offline usage. This tool proves immensely valuable to developers as it serves as a convenient scratchpad for storing code snippets and coding ideas. Please find the user story below.

##User Story
As a developer,
I want to create and store notes or code snippets with or without an internet connection,
so that I can easily retrieve them for later use.

##Installation
To install the necessary dependencies for this project, simply clone the repository and run the command "npm install". This will automatically install all the required dependencies listed in the package.json file.
